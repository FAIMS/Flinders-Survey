            <description>Level (less than 1% slope) to very gently inclined, complex landform pattern of extremely low relief.

The landform pattern includes areas that are bar plains, being aggraded or eroded by frequently active channelled stream flow, and other areas comprising terraces or stagnant alluvial plains with slopes that are greater than usual, formed by channelled stream flow but now relict. Incision in the upslope area may give rise to an erosional stream bed between scarps. Typical elements: stream bed, bar, plain. Compare with Sheet-flood fan and Pediment</description>
